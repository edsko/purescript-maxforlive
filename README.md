# purescript-maxforlive

[PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/) bindings for
[Max for Live](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8).

The goal of this library is not to merely provide bindings against the Max for
Live (JavaScript) API, but to provide a _strongly typed_ API for working with
Max for Live.

This library is in the early design stages and will undoubtedly still change
in lots of ways, the API is nowhere near stable yet.
